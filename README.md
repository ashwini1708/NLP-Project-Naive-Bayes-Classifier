NaiÌˆve Bayes Classifier in Python:

nblearn.py will learn a naive Bayes model from labeled data, and nbclassify.py will use the model to classify new data. nblearn.py will be invoked in the following way:
  >python3 nblearn.py /path/to/input

The argument is a data directory. The script should search through the directory recursively looking for subdirectories containing the folders: "ham" and "spam". Emails are stored in files with the extension ".txt" under these directories.

"ham" and "spam" folders contain emails failing into the category of the folder name (i.e., a spam folder will contain only spam emails and a ham folder will contain only ham emails). Each email is stored in a separate text file. The emails have been preprocessed removing HTML tags, and leaving only the body and the subject. The files have been tokenized such that white space always separates tokens.

nblearn.py will learn a naive Bayes model from the training data, and write the model parameters to a file called nbmodel.txt. The format of the model is up to you, but it should contain sufficient information for nbclassify.py to successfully classify new data.
nbclassify.py will be invoked in the following way: >python3 nbclassify.py /path/to/input
